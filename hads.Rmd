Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale

Download the [experimentum file](hads/hads_experimentum.json) to set this questionnaire up on an [experimentum](https://github.com/debruine/experimentum) server.

### Instructions

Doctors are aware that emotions play an important part in most illnesses. If your doctor knows about these feelings he or she will be able to help you more. This questionnaire is designed to help your doctor know how you feel. Read each item and circle the reply which comes closest to how you have been feeling in the past week. Donâ€™t take too long over your replies: your immediate reaction to each item will probably be more accurate than a long thought out response.
